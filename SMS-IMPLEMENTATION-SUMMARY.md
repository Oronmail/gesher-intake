# SMS Implementation Summary - October 29, 2025

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. Updated SMS Service (`src/lib/sms.ts`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Fixed phone number formatting to match Inwise format: `972-XX-XXXXXXX`
- ✅ Updated API request body to match official Inwise specification:
  ```json
  {
    "message": {
      "content": "...",
      "charset": "unicode",
      "to": [{"mobile_number": "972-50-1234567"}]
    }
  }
  ```
- ✅ Added support for both authentication headers:
  - `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
  - `X-API-Key: {token}`
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for API responses
- ✅ Added response status parsing (queued, sent, rejected, invalid)
- ✅ Improved logging with `[SMS]` prefixes

**File Location:** [src/lib/sms.ts](gesher-intake/src/lib/sms.ts)

### 2. Added Counselor SMS Notification (`src/app/api/referrals/consent/route.ts`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Imported `sendCounselorSMS` from SMS library
- ✅ Added SMS notification after parent signs consent
- ✅ Sends to `counselor_mobile` if provided
- ✅ Tracks both email and SMS delivery status
- ✅ Logs notification results for debugging

**File Location:** [src/app/api/referrals/consent/route.ts](gesher-intake/src/app/api/referrals/consent/route.ts#L139-L154)

### 3. Created Comprehensive Test Script
**Features:**
- ✅ Tests phone number formatting
- ✅ Tests both authentication methods
- ✅ Sends Hebrew test message
- ✅ Displays detailed API request/response
- ✅ Provides troubleshooting guidance

**File Location:** [test-sms.js](gesher-intake/test-sms.js)

**Usage:**
```bash
node test-sms.js 0501234567
```

### 4. Updated Documentation
**Files Updated:**
- ✅ [CLAUDE.md](gesher-intake/CLAUDE.md) - Updated SMS integration section
- ✅ [.env.example](gesher-intake/.env.example) - Already had SMS variables
- ✅ Created [SMS-INTEGRATION.md](gesher-intake/SMS-INTEGRATION.md) - Complete setup guide

## 📋 Next Steps (For You to Complete)

### Step 1: Add API Token to Local Environment
1. Open `.env.local` in the `gesher-intake` folder
2. Add your Inwise API token:
   ```env
   INWISE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_token_here
   INWISE_BASE_URL=https://api.inwise.com/rest/v1
   INWISE_SENDER_ID=GesherYouth
   ```
3. Save the file

### Step 2: Test SMS Locally
```bash
cd gesher-intake
node test-sms.js 0501234567
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Configuration check passes
- ✅ Phone number formatted to `972-50-1234567`
- ✅ SMS sent successfully
- ✅ You receive the test SMS on the phone

**If Test Fails:**
- Check API token is correct (no extra spaces)
- Verify Inwise account has credits
- Try the alternative phone number format
- Review error messages in console output

### Step 3: Test Full Workflow Locally
```bash
cd gesher-intake
npm run dev
```

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Fill counselor form with:
   - Your phone number as parent phone
   - Your email as parent email
3. Submit form
4. **Verify:** You receive SMS with consent link
5. Click the consent link
6. Sign the consent form
7. **Verify:** Counselor receives SMS with student form link

### Step 4: Deploy to Production

#### Add Environment Variables to Vercel:
```bash
cd gesher-intake

# Add API key
vercel env add INWISE_API_KEY
# Paste your API token when prompted
# Select: Production, Preview, Development (all)

# Confirm other variables exist
vercel env ls
```

#### Deploy:
```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Enable SMS notifications via Inwise API

- Updated SMS service to match Inwise API format
- Added counselor SMS notifications after consent
- Created comprehensive test script
- Updated documentation"

# Push to GitHub (triggers automatic Vercel deployment)
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Test in Production
1. Go to https://gesher-intake.vercel.app
2. Submit counselor form with real phone number
3. Verify parent receives SMS
4. Sign consent
5. Verify counselor receives SMS

#### Monitor Logs:
```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
vercel logs --prod --follow

# Filter for SMS logs
vercel logs --prod | grep SMS
```

### Phone Number Handling
```javascript
// All these formats work:
"0501234567"      → "972-50-1234567"
"972501234567"    → "972-50-1234567"
"+972501234567"   → "972-50-1234567"
"050-123-4567"    → "972-50-1234567"
```

### Error Handling
- ✅ SMS service not configured → Skips SMS, email still works
- ✅ Invalid phone number → Logs error, continues workflow
- ✅ Authentication failure → Tries alternative auth method
- ✅ Insufficient credits → Logs error, email fallback works
- ✅ Network timeout → Catches error, doesn't block process
