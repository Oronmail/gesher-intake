## What is an SMS Gateway?

An SMS gateway is the service provider that actually sends the SMS messages. Inwise is the platform that manages your messages, but they need to connect to an SMS gateway provider to actually deliver the messages to phone numbers.

Think of it like:
- **Inwise** = Post Office (manages your mail)
- **SMS Gateway** = Delivery truck (actually delivers the mail)

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Contact Inwise Support (URGENT)

Send them the updated support request: **[INWISE-SUPPORT-REQUEST.md](INWISE-SUPPORT-REQUEST.md)**

Key questions to ask:
1. **How do we configure an SMS gateway for our account?**
2. Is the gateway configuration automatic, or does it need manual setup?
3. Are there specific gateway providers for Israel/Hebrew SMS?
4. Do we need to configure credits or billing first?
5. Is there a minimum account tier required?

### 2. Check Your Inwise Account Settings

Look for any of these sections in your Inwise dashboard:
- SMS Settings
- Gateway Configuration
- Messaging Providers
- SMS Credits/Billing
- Account Settings > SMS

### 3. Possible Solutions

The issue might be:
- **No gateway configured**: You need to select/configure an SMS gateway provider
- **No credits**: You need to add credits to your account
- **Account tier**: You might need to upgrade your account plan
- **Pending activation**: Inwise support needs to activate SMS gateway access

## What We've Done (Technical)

### Updated Error Handling

Updated [src/lib/sms.ts](src/lib/sms.ts) to:
- Detect the `no-available-gateways` error specifically
- Handle Inwise's array response format
- Provide clear error messages for different failure scenarios
- Log detailed information for debugging

### New Error Messages

When testing, you'll now see clearer errors:
```
[SMS] ‚ùå No SMS gateway configured in Inwise account
[SMS] Please contact Inwise support to configure SMS gateway
Error: No SMS gateway configured - contact Inwise support to set up SMS gateway in your account
```

3. **Check**: If credits/billing setup is required
4. **Verify**: Account tier has SMS sending capabilities

  ```
  [SMS] ‚úÖ SMS sent successfully: [transaction_id]
  ```
