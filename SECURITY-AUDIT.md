- 72-hour automatic data deletion
- Secure connection strings
- No direct database access from frontend

### 5. API Security ‚úÖ
- API routes protected by middleware
- Request validation on all endpoints
- Error messages don't expose sensitive info
- Proper HTTP status codes
- CSRF protection via SameSite cookies

### 6. Salesforce Integration ‚úÖ
- **JWT Bearer authentication** (no password storage)
- Certificate-based authentication
- Automatic token refresh
- Secure field mapping
- No sensitive data in logs

### 7. Email/SMS Services ‚úÖ
- Gmail uses app-specific passwords (not main password)
- Inwise API key properly secured
- No credentials in email templates
- Rate limiting on notifications
- Secure SMTP connection

### 8. Frontend Security ‚úÖ
- No sensitive data in localStorage
- Secure session handling
- CSP prevents inline scripts
- React's built-in XSS protection
- No eval() or dangerous functions

### 9. Middleware Protection ‚úÖ
```typescript
// Key security middleware features:
- Rate limiting per IP
- CORS with strict origins
- API key validation for external access
- Security headers on all responses
- Request size limits
```

## üîç Security Audit Findings

### ‚úÖ PASSED Checks

1. **Credentials**: No exposed API keys, passwords, or tokens
2. **Dependencies**: All packages up to date (via npm audit)
3. **HTTPS**: Enforced in production via Vercel
4. **Data Encryption**: At rest (Supabase) and in transit (HTTPS)
5. **Authentication**: Proper JWT implementation with Salesforce
6. **Authorization**: Public forms (by design), admin functions secured
7. **Logging**: No sensitive data in console logs
8. **Error Handling**: Generic error messages to users
9. **File Upload**: Signatures handled securely as base64
10. **GDPR/Privacy**: Consent before data collection

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommendations (Non-Critical)

1. **Add reCAPTCHA**: Prevent bot submissions on public forms
2. **Implement honeypot fields**: Additional bot protection
3. **Add request signing**: For Salesforce webhook callbacks
4. **Enable Supabase audit logs**: Track all data modifications
5. **Implement session timeout**: For future admin features
6. **Add security.txt**: Public vulnerability disclosure policy

- [x] CORS origins restricted
- [x] API keys rotated from development

### Runtime Security ‚úÖ
- [x] No console.log with sensitive data
- [x] Error messages sanitized

## üö® Critical Security Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Credential Rotation Required

The `.env.local` file contains ACTUAL production credentials that need to be:
1. **Removed from local machine** after deployment
2. **Stored securely** in password manager
3. **Rotated regularly** (every 90 days)
4. **Never shared** via email/chat

### Credential Storage Best Practices
```bash
# After deployment, remove local .env.local
rm .env.local

# Store credentials in:
# 1. Vercel Dashboard (primary)
# 2. Secure password manager (backup)
# 3. Encrypted backup (offline)
```

## üîê Security Maintenance Schedule

### Daily
- Monitor Vercel logs for suspicious activity
- Check Supabase for unusual queries

### Weekly
- Review error logs for security issues
- Check rate limiting effectiveness

### Monthly
- Audit user submissions for patterns
- Review Salesforce integration logs
- Check email bounce rates

### Quarterly
- Rotate API keys and passwords
- Update security headers if needed
- Review and update dependencies
- Penetration testing (if budget allows)

---

## üìä Compliance Status

### Privacy Regulations ‚úÖ
